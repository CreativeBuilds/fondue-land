### A Jackpot Website created for CheeseDAO

Users participate in a jackpot game where the goal is to be the last one to deposit a key in, in order to "Take the Pot"

Funds from key purchases increase the pots reward. Consiquently the keys get more expensive as more are purchased, eventually reaching a point where its unfeasible to purchase more. This mechanic enables the game to ensure that the round will eventually end with a winner instead of going on indefinitelly.

Initial fork comes from Scaffold-ETH
